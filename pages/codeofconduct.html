              member is found spamming on this server, then he/she will face
              severe consequences. Spamming includes excessive caps,

            <li>
              Once you have created a username for yourself, maintain the same
              throughout the program. If any member changes his/her username,
              then the username which is not registered with the organizing
              committee will cease to be a part of the program.
